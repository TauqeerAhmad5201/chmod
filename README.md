# chmod
chmod - change mode

### Different permission examples: 
The chmod command uses a symbolic or numeric mode to specify the permissions to be set. Here's an explanation of the different permissions and how they can be assigned using chmod:

### Numeric Mode:

    The numeric mode represents permissions using three-digit a  octal number: xyz.
    x represents the permission for the owner, y for the group, and z for others.
    Each digit can be calculated by adding the values of the following permissions:
        Read (r): 4
        Write (w): 2
        Execute (x): 1
    For example, chmod 755 filename sets the owner to have read, write, and execute permissions (4+2+1 = 7), while the group and others have read and execute permissions (4+1 = 5).
    
### Symbolic Mode 

    The symbolic mode uses a combination of letters and symbols to specify permissions.
    u represents the owner, g represents the group, o represents others, and a represents all (u+g+o).
    + adds permissions, - removes permissions, and = sets the permissions explicitly.
    The basic permission letters are:
        Read (r)
        Write (w)
        Execute (x)
        
 ###   Additional symbolic notations:

    Setuid (s): Allows a file to be executed with the permissions of the file's owner.
    Setgid (s): Allows a file to be executed with the permissions of the file's group.
    Sticky bit (t): When set on a directory, only the owner of a file can delete or rename it.

For example:

    chmod u+x filename adds execute permission for the owner.
    chmod go-rwx directory removes read, write, and execute permissions for the group and others.
    chmod a=rw file.txt sets read and write permissions for all (owner, group, and others), removing execute permission if it was set.

    These are the basic concepts of using chmod to manage file permissions in DevOps. It's important to understand the implications of changing permissions and use them judiciously to ensure the security and accessibility of files and directories in your system.
 

# What  is chmod +x _filename_

The chmod +x command is used to add the execute permission to a file. When you set the execute permission, you allow the file to be executed or run as a program.

In the symbolic mode, the +x part means adding the execute permission for all users. Here's a breakdown of the symbolic notation:

    + signifies adding the specified permission.
    x represents the execute permission.

## Q: is chmod +x and chmod u+x same

Yes, chmod +x and chmod u+x are essentially the same and accomplish the same result. Both commands add the execute permission for the owner of the file.

In the symbolic mode, u+x specifically adds the execute permission for the user (owner) of the file. On the other hand, +x adds the execute permission for all users (owner, group, and others).

Therefore, when you use chmod +x filename or chmod u+x filename, you are granting the owner the ability to execute the file as a program.

It's important to note that if the file already has other execute permissions set for the group or others, using chmod +x will retain those permissions while adding the execute permission for the owner.
